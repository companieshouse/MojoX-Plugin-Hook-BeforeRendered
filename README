NAME
    MojoX::Plugin::Hook::BeforeRendered - Plugin to inject before_rendered
    hook into Mojolicious

SYNOPSIS
      sub startup
      {
        ...
        ...
        $self->plugin('MojoX::Plugin::Hook::BeforeRendered');
        ...
        ...
      }

      $c->hook( before_rendered => sub {
        my ($next, $c) = @_;

        ... do stuff ...

        $next->();
      });

DESCRIPTION
    MojoX::Plugin::Hook::BeforeRendered patches Mojolicious to provide a
    before_rendered hook. This is emitted at the start of the "rendered", as
    content is about to be returned to the client.

    This is similar to "after_render", but unlike after_render, allows
    non-blocking operations to be performed, only proceeding with the return
    of content to the client when $next->() is called. Further more, it is
    emitted for redirects etc as well as rendered content such as HTML or
    JSON.
